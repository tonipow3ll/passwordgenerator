# Random Password Generator
## For this assignment - we were tasked with making a password generator.
### A user can click on the 'generate' button, and a string of random lowercase letters, with numbers, or symbols will appear. By default if no selections are made the generator will only use lowercase characters. Users are able to select the total length of their desired password, and copy it to their clipboard for later use.
