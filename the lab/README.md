# Random Password Generator
### For this assignment - we were tasked with making a password generator.
### A user can click on the 'generate' button, and a string of random uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols will appear. Users are able to select the total length of their desired password, and copy it to their clipboard for later use.

#### The version shown below does not include some features that I am still working on. The next version that I am working on will default to lowercase values, but will give users the option to add 'uppercase values' 'numbers' or 'symbols' , combine all four options, or use only one option. 


[here is what the final version will look like]
